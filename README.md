Kong :- 

Simply, it’s an API gateway, that sits in front of your backend services and forwards client requests to those services. Since Kong is the first point that client requests hit, it can transform and/or routes any requests or responses based on your configuration. So you can manipulate any requests or responses by adding, appending or removing headers on the fly and route them to wherever you want.

What’s more, as an abstraction layer it provides additional features with its plugins such as authentication, rate limiting, caching, logging, bot detection, CORS, IP restriction and many more. This means, that developers don’t need to implement these features in each micro services, thus they can be more focused on business logic which improves productivity.

Kong is a kind of “platform agnostic” solution that runs on almost every platform. You can run it as a docker container or install on a GNU/Linux distribution in on-premise or cloud based environments. Even, it can run as an kubernetes ingress controller.
