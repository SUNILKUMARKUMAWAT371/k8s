-> if we not give operator for tolerate then they take bydefault equal operator

        tolerations:
          - effect: ""
            key: "mysize"
            value: "large"

-> if we add effect=NoSchedule, operator=Equal then they schedular assign pod to particular node.

        tolerations:
          - effect: "NoSchedule"
            key: "mysize"
            operator: "Equal"
            value: "large"

-> if we add effect=NoSchedule, operator=Exists then pod assign to any node ,not to perticular node.

        tolerations:
          - effect: "NoSchedule"
            key: "mysize"
            operator: "Exists"
            value: "large"

-> if we are not given effect=""  then schedular tolerate all three effect NoSchedule, NoExecute and PreferNoSchedule

        tolerations:
          - effect: ""
            key: "mysize"
            operator: "Equal"
            value: "large"


-> if we not given value in pod then schedular match "key" and any thing have value then they assign pod to match "key" node

        tolerations:
          - effect: "NoSchedule"
            key: "mysize"
            operator: "Exists"

-> if we are not given key: "" and give operator is Exists then they tolerate anything 

        tolerations:
          - effect: ""
            key: ""
            operator: "Exists"

-> if we define tolerationSeconds: in tolerations defination or block then they staytune pod for given time

        tolerations:
          - key: "key1"
            operator: "Equal"
            value: "value1"
            effect: "NoExecute"
            tolerationSeconds: 3600
